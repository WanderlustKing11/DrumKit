# DrumKit
Simple landing page with playable drum kit, using event listeners "click" &amp; "keydown", and passing functions with DOM

Use the keyboard to press the key's shown (currently 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', and 'l') and trigger a sound.

This is a JS online course follow-along project, from Udemy.
So it's not an original idea at all, but just a means to learn.

The goal was to learn DOM and JS. The sounds are not particularly great, so I think it would be neat to come back
and redo this website with better quality audio.

The speed of the sound being applied is not perfect, so maintaining an accurate beat is rather hard.

Anyway, hope you guys enjoy messing with it, too! Have fun.
