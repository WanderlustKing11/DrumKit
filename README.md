# DrumKit
Simple landing page with playable drum kit, using event listeners "click" &amp; "keydown", and passing functions with DOM

Use the keyboard to press the key's shown (currently 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', and 'l') and trigger a sound.

The goal was to learn DOM and JS. The sounds are not particularly great, so I think it would be neat to come back
and redo this website with better quality audio.

The speed of the sound being applied is not perfect, so maintaining an accurate beat is rather hard. If anything, I'd like to redo this project so it runs on a server with Node and Express, which might help make the audio more accurate.

Anyway, hope you guys enjoy messing with it, too! Have fun.
